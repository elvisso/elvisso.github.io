									<p>Hi, thanks for clicking into this page and I guess you would like to know why this page was set up at first.</p>
									<p>So it all started with a lightbulb that constantly gives me ideas everyday. One day I was updating my resume and the lightbulb "tinged" all of a sudden. "Hey! How about a portfolio website showing all my projects and my journey so far?" This is where the fun begins. </p>
									<p>I then started to google about "Portfolio Website" and I was instanly obsessed with this idea. I have watched several Youtube videos and multiple guides as well in order to get a sense of how to build my own site. After all these research, <i>(yes I tend to do a lot of research before actions, that's me)</i>, I jotted down a list to actually make this happen:</p>
									<h3>What is required:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>HTML course</li>
										<li>Projects</li>
										<li>Practice</li>
										<li>Patience</li>
										<li>Concentration</li>
									  </ul>	

									<h3>How it started</h3>
									<p>I finished watching the Youtube videos and started to gather the resources required. First I went to HTML5 UP to get a HTML template that suits as a Portfolio Website. I also downloaded the Visual Code Studio as recommended, along with the Live Server extension to get the content updated side-by-side. Progress have been made and I was starting to get used to this environment to speed up. Downloaded a few pictures from Unsplash. Planned on the structure and created a few pages. Goolgle it whenever I want to have new features.</p>
									<h3>Updates (Mar 2023)</h3>
									<p>Now I am working on the dashboards / Python projects that would help showcase my skills. It has been a nice journey so far, getting to learn a new langauge at the same time building a site of my own. It is easier than I thought but probably this is only the beginning. I would update this blog when we reach the next stage.</p>
